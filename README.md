Develop a UI-Less Mobile Application(Smartphone and Smartwatch) that has intelligence definitely AI-Powered automated Text generation for Product or Service Reviews. Here are some future features that they will have:

1. Voice Communication using NLP, Text Classification, Word Representation and Sentiment Analysis (Connected with Calendar Events and Online Shop Authentication)

Example Use Case:
A User named 'B' set a calendar event for writing and submitting two product reviews.

Calendar Event: 24 March, 2021 6:30 AM

So at that time, the user is performing morning Jogging in the park and taking fresh air. On the time of the event, the voice assistant of the user's mobile says to the user 

Vocal Assistant: "Sir, I need to do a product review on your behalf. Do you want to do this?"

User: "Sure, go ahead."

Vocal Assistant: "Thank you, Sir, for your confirmation. Now please, tell me your password for Amazon."

User: "xxxxxx"

Vocal Assistant: "Thank you, please wait and with a moment, you will get an SMS containing OTP. After received, please tell to me."
Waiting for OTP.

User: "Hey Mr. Assistant, please take Amazon OTP: xxxxxx."

Vocal Assistant: "Sir, thank you, can you please tell me again for cross-validation, please? Hope you will understand."

User: "xxxxxx" 

Vocal Assistant: "Thank you Sir for your kind cooperation."

After few moments later, the Vocal Assistant replied to the User 'B'

Vocal Assistant: "Sir, product review successfully submitted and waiting for confirmation."
